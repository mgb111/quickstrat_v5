## Payment Button IDs

The integration uses these Razorpay payment button IDs:

- **Annual Plan**: `pl_QsXQiWLwBcQ8x5`

## How It Works

### 1. User Flow
1. User visits the pricing section on the landing page
2. User selects monthly or yearly billing cycle
3. User clicks the Razorpay payment button
4. Razorpay checkout opens in a modal
5. User completes payment
6. Payment success callback updates user subscription
7. User gains access to premium features

### 2. Payment Processing
1. Razorpay handles the payment securely
2. On success, `onPaymentSuccess` callback is triggered
3. PaymentService updates user subscription in database
4. User's subscription status is updated in real-time
5. Analytics events are tracked for conversion analysis

### 3. Database Updates
- User's plan is updated to 'premium'
- Subscription status is set to 'active'
- Payment record is logged in payments table
- Last payment date is updated
