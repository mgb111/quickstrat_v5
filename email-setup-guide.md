# Email Setup Guide

## Current Status
The email functionality is currently **not configured** in your app. This means:
- ✅ PDF downloads work immediately
- ❌ Email delivery is not working
- ❌ Lead capture emails are not sent

## Quick Fix: Use PDF Download Only
For now, users can download the PDF directly without email capture:
1. Go to the results page
2. Click "Download PDF" button
3. PDF downloads immediately to their device

## To Enable Email Functionality

### Option 1: Configure Email Service (Recommended)
1. **Choose an email provider:**
   - SendGrid (free tier: 100 emails/day)
   - Mailgun (free tier: 5,000 emails/month)
   - Resend (free tier: 3,000 emails/month)

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```env
   VITE_EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid
   VITE_SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   VITE_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
   VITE_FROM_NAME=Your Brand Name
   ```

3. **Configure Supabase Storage:**
   - Create a storage bucket called `lead-magnets`
   - Set up proper permissions

### Option 2: Use Supabase Edge Functions
1. Create a Supabase Edge Function for email sending
2. Configure email templates
3. Set up proper authentication

### Option 3: Third-party Service
Use services like:
- ConvertKit
- Mailchimp
- ActiveCampaign
- Zapier (to connect to any email service)

## Current Workflow
1. User creates campaign
2. PDF is generated immediately
3. User can download PDF directly
4. Email capture is optional for lead collection

## Benefits of Current Setup
- ✅ **Immediate PDF access** - no email required
- ✅ **No email configuration needed**
- ✅ **Works offline**
- ✅ **Faster user experience**

## When to Add Email
Add email functionality when you want to:
- Collect leads for follow-up
- Send additional resources
- Build an email list
- Track user engagement

For now, the PDF download works perfectly without email setup!
