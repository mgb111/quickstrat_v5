# QuickStrat App Walkthrough Script for Loom

## Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)
"Hey everyone! Today I'm going to walk you through QuickStrat, an AI-powered lead generation platform that helps businesses create targeted lead magnets, host landing pages, and capture leads automatically. This tool is perfect for anyone looking to grow their email list and generate more qualified leads."

## Overview of the App (0:30 - 1:00)
"QuickStrat is built with React and TypeScript, uses Supabase for the backend, and integrates with OpenAI to generate personalized content. The app has four main components:
1. A campaign creation wizard
2. A dashboard for managing campaigns
3. Hosted landing pages for lead capture
4. Automated email delivery with PDF attachments

Let me show you how it all works together."

## Starting the Demo (1:00 - 1:30)
"First, let me open the app in my browser. As you can see, we start with a clean, modern interface. The app is fully responsive and works great on both desktop and mobile devices."

## Authentication Flow (1:30 - 2:00)
"Before we can create campaigns, users need to authenticate. The app uses Supabase for authentication, which provides secure user management. Once logged in, users are taken to their dashboard where they can see all their campaigns."

## Dashboard Overview (2:00 - 3:00)
"Here's the main dashboard. You can see it's clean and organized with:
- A list of all campaigns on the left
- Campaign statistics and metrics
- Lead management tools
- Quick actions for each campaign

The dashboard shows key metrics like lead count, conversion rates, and campaign performance. Users can also export their lead data as CSV files for use in other tools."

## Creating a New Campaign (3:00 - 5:00)
"Let's create a new campaign. I'll click the 'Create Campaign' button, which takes us to the campaign creation wizard. This is where the magic happens!

The wizard has four steps:
1. **Input** - We collect information about the business and target audience
2. **Focus** - AI generates lead magnet concepts based on the input
3. **Review** - We review and approve the content outline
4. **Complete** - The final lead magnet is generated and saved

Let me fill out the campaign information form. I'll use a digital marketing agency as an example:
- Brand Name: Digital Growth Pro
- Niche: Digital Marketing
- Target Audience: Small business owners aged 30-50 who struggle with social media marketing
- Problem Statement: Small business owners struggle to create effective social media strategies because they lack time, knowledge, and a clear system to follow
- Desired Outcome: Create a consistent social media presence that generates leads and builds brand awareness
- Tone: Professional but approachable

Now I'll submit this information and the AI will generate lead magnet concepts for us."

## AI Concept Generation (5:00 - 6:00)
"While the AI is working, you can see the loading animation. The system is using OpenAI's API to analyze our input and generate focused lead magnet concepts that will resonate with our target audience.

Here are the concepts it generated:
1. 'The 7-Day Social Media Framework' - A step-by-step guide
2. 'Social Media Content Calendar Template' - A practical tool
3. 'Social Media ROI Calculator' - An interactive resource

Each concept is designed to solve the specific problem we identified. I'll select the first one - the 7-Day Social Media Framework - as it provides immediate value and actionable steps."

## Content Outline Review (6:00 - 7:00)
"Now the AI is generating a detailed content outline for our lead magnet. This includes:
- An engaging introduction
- The main framework with 7 actionable steps
- Supporting examples and case studies
- A conclusion with next steps

The outline looks comprehensive and well-structured. I can approve it as-is or make any adjustments if needed. Let me approve it and move to the final generation step."

## Final Lead Magnet Generation (7:00 - 8:00)
"The system is now generating the complete lead magnet content, including:
- Professional copywriting
- Engaging headlines and subheadings
- Actionable tips and strategies
- A compelling call-to-action

Once complete, the campaign is automatically saved to our database and we're taken back to the dashboard where we can see our new campaign listed."

## Landing Page Creation (8:00 - 9:00)
"Now let's look at the landing page that was automatically created for this campaign. Each campaign gets its own unique URL that we can share with potential leads.

The landing page includes:
- A compelling headline based on our lead magnet
- Benefit bullets highlighting what users will get
- A simple email capture form
- Professional design that matches our brand

The page is fully responsive and optimized for conversions. Users can enter their email address to get instant access to the lead magnet."

## Lead Capture Process (9:00 - 10:00)
"Let me demonstrate the lead capture process. When someone visits the landing page and enters their email:

1. The email is validated and stored in our database
2. An automated welcome email is sent with the PDF attachment
3. The lead is tracked in our dashboard
4. We can follow up with additional emails

The system handles everything automatically - no manual work required!"

## Dashboard Management (10:00 - 11:00)
"Back in the dashboard, we can see our new lead has been captured. The dashboard shows:
- Total leads for this campaign
- Email delivery status
- PDF download tracking
- Campaign performance metrics

We can also:
- Export leads as CSV
- Copy the landing page URL
- View detailed analytics
- Manage multiple campaigns

This gives us complete visibility into our lead generation efforts."

## Mobile Experience (11:00 - 11:30)
"Let me quickly show you how the app looks on mobile. As you can see, everything is fully responsive and works perfectly on smaller screens. The forms are easy to fill out, buttons are properly sized for touch, and the navigation is mobile-friendly."
